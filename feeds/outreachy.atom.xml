&lt;p&gt;Gender identity is one's personal experience of one's …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Gender identity and expression is a positive, core part, of being human and experiencing wellbeing and fulfilment.

&lt;h2&gt;What exactly is Gender identity&lt;a name='what-exactly-is-gender-identity'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gender identity is one's personal experience of one's own gender.
&lt;div style="text-align: right"&gt;- Wikipedia&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gender identity can be the sex at birth or can differ as well. The social identity of a person, in relation to other members of society is served by their &lt;strong&gt;set of gender categories&lt;/strong&gt;. Most societies have a &lt;em&gt;gender binary&lt;/em&gt; which is a basic division between gender attributes assigned to &lt;strong&gt;males&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;females&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all societies, some individuals do not identify with some (or all) of the aspects of gender that are assigned to their biological sex; some of those individuals are &lt;strong&gt;transgender&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;genderqueer&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;non-binary&lt;/strong&gt;. There are some societies that have &lt;strong&gt;third gender&lt;/strong&gt; categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Role of age in Gender Identity&lt;a name='role-of-age-in-Gender-Identity'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This gives an insight for issue &lt;a href="https://github.com/mozilla/diversity/issues/96"&gt;#96&lt;/a&gt; in Mozilla/Diversity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Core gender identity is usually formed by age three, although children do not yet fully understand the implications of gender. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trans people who express their gender identity from an early age are often rejected by their families. If not cast out from their homes, they are shunned within households resulting in lack of opportunities for education and with no attempts to ensure attention to their mental and physical health needs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In universities, students aged under 18 are covered by special policies because they are in a distinct legal position because of their age and should obtain the assistance of a Student Adviser when, for example, seeking to change their student records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Gender Recognition Laws&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In certain countries, like Ireland, a certificate is issued under the Gender Recognition Act which enables trans people’s binary gender to be legally recognised from age &lt;strong&gt;sixteen&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A person over the age of 18 years should be able to choose to have an unspecified sex noted on documents and records. 
&lt;div style="text-align: right"&gt;- United Nations&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Gender Reassignment Therapy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another aspect in discussing about gender identity is access to gender reassignment therapy.Trans persons may elect to undergo gender reassignment surgery, which is usually available after a person has reached 18 years of age. However, in some countries, like the Netherlands, transgender youth may begin treatment to offset puberty and 
receive counselling, so as to allow them to make informed decisions about their future gender identity. Then at the age of 18 they can proceed with gender reassignment treatments, if they still wish to. Recently, some other countries, for example Belgium and Germany, have started 
to provide similar treatment for youth under &lt;strong&gt;18&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Teens understanding their gender&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One’s gender identity is their innermost concept of self as male, female, both, or neither. It also means that one’s gender identity can be the same or different than their sex assigned at birth. If &lt;strong&gt;a teen's&lt;/strong&gt; gender identity is different from their sex, they may be looking for &lt;strong&gt;support&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telling a friend or an adult about their gender identity can be a very emotional journey. While there are support groups, some feel safer to be themselves and explore issues online rather than sitting across the table from someone. Online communities are vailable for people between the age of &lt;strong&gt;13 and 19&lt;/strong&gt; which they can join to connect with other Gender-expansive youth and their allies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To conclude, I would say that the age of 19 seems to be good for asking gender identity from people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Designing forms for gender identity&lt;a name='designing-forms-for-gender-identity'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This gives an insight for issue &lt;a href="https://github.com/mozilla/diversity/issues/95"&gt;#95&lt;/a&gt; in Mozilla/Diversity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We discuss about some best practices to inculcate the most appropriate options when it comes to gender identity based on people’s common attitudes. Having a binary question is simple form &lt;strong&gt;cisgender&lt;/strong&gt; people. But what about people who don't consider themselves in one of those category. It may be a hurtful reminder of how their journey is not reflected in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trans &amp;amp; GNC people may have identified with several different gender labels as they discovered them. They may also think about pronouns they want other people to use while referring to them.
This may not be a journey to a destination, but a path. They are the ones shaping the path, creating, adopting and combining labels to feel comfort while they explore their feelings, and discarding old ones. The meaning they give to these labels can also vary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employers committed to diversity and inclusion should give these options: male, female, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender. Some thoughts to consider are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid using &lt;strong&gt;only&lt;/strong&gt; binary options for Gender Identity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An individual should be allowed to select &lt;em&gt;multiple&lt;/em&gt; options.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It should be &lt;strong&gt;clearly stated&lt;/strong&gt; whether they change the selected options later. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apart from the choices, having a &lt;em&gt;optional&lt;/em&gt; description for Gender Identity is a good practice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prefer not to say&lt;/em&gt; is always good to have.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

I have seen what is the gender spread across communities, their contributions on Github aing with their Employment status. The data was extracted from Github's Open Source survey from 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Users who value cost&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that cost plays a major part of selecting a project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Plot 1" src="https://i.imgur.com/3C3Ivgz.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a total of 4126 Users on which the survey did not have a NaN value. Out of those, 3648 people value the cost of the project which makes around 88.4% of the users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Github Users by Gender&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Plot 2" src="https://i.imgur.com/9UWFD7b.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that the gender distribution among Github users is not that evenly distributed as 95.4 % of total Github users are men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Employment Status of People&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full time Employed users tend to use Github more than any other users. This indicates that organisations, nowadays, are moving towards Open Source. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;img alt="Plot 3" src="https://i.imgur.com/7GLZwhh.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another aspect which can be looked at is the number of users on Github.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Plot 4" src="https://i.imgur.com/wCr9XkR.png"&gt;
The Pie-Chart very well represents that Github is used by64.1% full time employed users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Plot 5" src="https://i.imgur.com/dhoM0BA.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, when looked at full time employed users, we can see that women constitute only 3.5% of the total users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We shall now see how much does women contribute in code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Plot 6" src="https://i.imgur.com/MR2b4Cf.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is saddening to see that only 32.4% of the total women contribute Frequently. To solifdify if we are heading right, lets see the total number of users about whom we are talking about. There seem to be data of only about 74 women, so this measure may not be an accurate way to come to a conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Where do people get help&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When analysed, it was seen that 56.0% people got help from people that they never knew before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Plot 7" src="https://i.imgur.com/jXf48SG.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end I conclude that the percentage of Women in OSS is way behind that of men. Also, OSS seems to be a friendly environment as people get help from others whom they have not known before. This creates a platform for women to come and showcase their skills.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Outreachy"></category></entry><entry><title>Using FOSS Heartbeat for generating insights in Normandy</title><link href="/using-foss-heartbeat-for-generating-insights-in-normandy.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-03-19T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2018-03-19T00:00:00+05:30</updated><author><name>Akshita Gupta</name></author><id>tag:None,2018-03-19:/using-foss-heartbeat-for-generating-insights-in-normandy.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Task&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To analyse the FOSS Hearbeat tool and understand the health of the community. The tool uses CoreNLP algorithms and the GitHub API to
gather information about the language and etiquette expressed in the PRs and the Issues of a repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why did I choose this repository?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this task, I analysed the Mozilla's repository, &lt;a href="https://github.com/mozilla/normandy"&gt;Normandy&lt;/a&gt;. 
As per issue &lt;a href="https://github.com/mozilla/diversity/issues/89"&gt;#89&lt;/a&gt; of Mozilla's &lt;a href="https://github.com/mozilla/diversity"&gt;Diversity&lt;/a&gt;, I have been working to be a part of it through the Outreachy program. We were told to see any of active Mozilla repos from this list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/mozilla?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;q=firefox&amp;amp;type=&amp;amp;language="&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/mozilla?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;q=rust&amp;amp;type=&amp;amp;language="&gt;Rust&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As most of my work revolves around python, I chose to go to the first link and find the repos that use python.
From there, I came to know about Normandy and thought it would be great to see the insights about the health of this community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Some of the insights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People help each other&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Plot 1" src="https://i.imgur.com/89mqqAV.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that people tend to help others as the comments made by a person on other's issue is huge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most issues are opened by newcomers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Plot 2" src="https://i.imgur.com/77UFJoo.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This plot demonstrates that most issues are genrated by people who are new to the organisation. We can say that they seem to be more interested in knowing more about the project and give ideas for it as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response to Pull Requests&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Plot 3" src="https://i.imgur.com/bI5wdDT.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This plot demonstrates how Normandy Maintainers respond quickly to the pull requests that are opened. The feedback is instant and very helpful!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Inference&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FOSS Heartbeat tool is mapsa various kinds of insights and gives a very encouraging statistics about the health of an oranisation.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Outreachy"></category></entry></feed>
